# RPS-Multiplayer
An Online Multiplayer RPS Experience made using Javascript, JQuery, and Firebase.

RPS Online allows users to play and spectate a single-serving Rock Paper Scissors waiting room. Beyond the game itself there is a small chatroom functionality allowing both players and spectators to converse.

# Firebase Functionality
RPS Online was made possible by using Firebase to track everything from the game states to the user hands to the chat log. The chat log is persistent as long as at least one user remains on the page, meaning late-joiners can still see all previous messages.
